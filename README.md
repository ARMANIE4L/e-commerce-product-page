## My process
I first created the html, then styled it and gave it live with javascript. The entire process took me 2 weeks and it was such an exciting journey.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- javascript bootsrap
- css bootsrap
- Javascript

### What I learned

THis project afforded me the opportunity to learn alot of new things on both css and javascript. I laerned how to taregt dynamically added elements and attach eventListeners to it.


### Continued development

During this project i got to solve my long term problem of not being able to reup dynamically added contents when i close it. At first i used the remove() method to remove dynamucally added elements, i later started to use display.hide css property. I wish to develop on that.
